# NeuroSentinel Architecture

## Overview

NeuroSentinel is a Layer-1 blockchain designed for AI trust and intelligence.

It combines:
- Proof of Intelligence (PoI)
- Proof of Trust (PoT)
- AI identity and reputation
- Trust graph ledger
- Future smart contract support

## Core Components

### 1. Core Layer
Handles:
- block structure
- state management
- networking
- transaction processing

### 2. Consensus Layer
Hybrid consensus using:
- Proof of Intelligence (capability)
- Proof of Trust (reliability)

Validator power = Intelligence × Trust

### 3. Trust Engine
Maintains:
- agent identity
- trust scores
- intelligence scores
- verification history

### 4. AI Task Network
Provides:
- task pool
- verification system
- scoring updates

## Data Flow

1. Agent submits task result
2. Validators verify correctness
3. Trust & intelligence scores updated
4. Block finalized
5. Trust graph updated

## Future Layers

- Smart contracts (WASM)
- AI marketplaces
- DAO governance
- Cross-chain integration
